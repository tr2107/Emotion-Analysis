# Emotion-Analysis
An emotion analysis project uses NLP and machine learning to detect emotions in text, like social media posts or reviews. By training models on labeled datasets, it identifies emotions such as happiness or anger. This can improve customer service, enhance user experience, and assist in emotional health assessments.
